# Truth-Telling with Dignity

Deliver difficult truths in a way that honors both honesty and human dignity. Speak truth without cruelty, challenge without destroying.

---

## When to Use

- Need to give honest but difficult feedback
- Must confront someone about a problem
- Facing a hard conversation you've been avoiding
- Speaking truth to power or authority
- User asks "How do I tell them the hard truth?" or "I need to be honest but I don't want to hurt them"

|-------|----------|-------------|
| truth | Yes | The difficult truth that needs to be communicated |
| relationship | No | Context of the relationship (boss, friend, partner, colleague) |
| goal | No | Desired outcome beyond delivering the truth |

## The Framework

Maya Angelou understood that truth-telling is an act of love, not cruelty. "There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you." The untold truth poisons the bearer and denies the receiver the chance to respond, grow, or change.

But truth delivered without care becomes a weapon. The goal is compassionate confrontation—challenging people while embracing them, holding up mirrors with love.

### Step 1: Check Your Intention

Why are you telling this truth? Truth-telling from love looks different than truth-telling from anger, frustration, or self-righteousness.

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- Am I speaking this truth for their benefit or my release?
- Do I want them to change, or do I want to be right?
- Am I willing to stay in relationship after this truth is told?
- Have I earned the right to speak this truth to this person?

**Maya's insight:** "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."

### Step 2: Honor the Whole Person

The person receiving this truth is more than their mistake, blind spot, or failure. See them completely before speaking.

**What to remember:**
- Their history and context
- Their intentions, even if their impact was different
- Their capacity to receive and grow
- Their dignity, which must survive this conversation

**Maya's insight:** "We are more alike than we are unalike." You have also needed to hear hard truths. You have also fallen short.

### Step 3: Prepare the Ground

Truth delivered into unprepared ground often fails to take root. Create conditions for the truth to be heard.

**Preparation includes:**
- Timing: Not in public, not when they're overwhelmed, not as an ambush
- Privacy: Give them space to react without audience
- Care first: Begin by affirming what is good and true about them
- Permission: "Can I share something that's been on my mind?"

**Maya's insight:** "Words are things. You must be careful... They get into people."

### Step 4: Speak the Truth Cleanly

No hedging. No endless qualifiers. No softening until the truth disappears. Clean truth is actually kinder than muddied truth.

**Clean truth includes:**
- "I" statements about impact: "When X happened, I felt Y"
- Specific observations, not global judgments: "In the meeting Tuesday" not "You always"
- The behavior or situation, not the character: What they DID, not who they ARE
- What you need or hope for going forward

**The dignity test:** Could you say this to someone you deeply respect who happened to make this mistake?

**Maya's insight:** "There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you."

### Step 5: Stay in Relationship

The truth is delivered. Now what? Truth-telling that hits and runs is not compassionate—it's cowardly. Stay present for the response.

**After truth-telling:**
- Give them space to respond, even if that response is difficult
- Listen to their perspective without defending
- Reaffirm your care for them and the relationship
- Be clear about path forward, not just the problem
- Follow up—truth without follow-through is abandonment

**Maya's insight:** "Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently."

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Never use truth as a weapon for anger or revenge
- Never attack character—address behavior
- Never ambush—prepare the ground
- Never hit and run—stay for the response
- Acknowledge when you might be wrong

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My friend keeps canceling plans at the last minute. It's happened five times in the past two months. I want to stay friends but I'm hurt and angry."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Truth-Telling with Dignity

### Intention Check
**Why this truth needs to be spoken:** Because the pattern is eroding your friendship from your side. The resentment is building. If you don't speak, you'll eventually withdraw or explode—neither of which serves the friendship.

**What you hope for after:** Not a perfect friend, but an honest conversation. Understanding why this keeps happening. Either a change, or at least acknowledgment that it matters.

### The Whole Person
**What is good and true about them:** They are your friend for reasons. There's history here, care here, something worth protecting. They may not know how this pattern is affecting you. They may be dealing with something you don't see.

**The context to remember:** People cancel for many reasons—anxiety, overwhelm, depression, overcommitment. This doesn't excuse the pattern, but it might explain it. Approach with curiosity, not just grievance.

### The Ground Prepared

**When to speak:** Not by text. Not right after another cancellation when you're angry. Choose a time when you're both calm and have space. Perhaps: "Can we get coffee this week? There's something on my mind."

**How to open:** Begin with the relationship, not the grievance. "You're important to me, and that's why I need to tell you something that's been bothering me."

### The Truth, Clean

**The observation:** "You've cancelled our plans five times in the past two months, usually at the last minute."

**The impact:** "When this happens, I feel like our friendship isn't a priority. I rearrange my schedule, turn down other invitations, and then I'm left hanging. It hurts."

**What you need:** "I need you to know that this pattern is affecting how I feel about our friendship. And I'd like to understand what's going on for you."

**Full statement:**
"You're important to me, and that's why I want to be honest with you. Over the past two months, you've cancelled our plans five times, usually at the last minute. When this happens, I feel hurt and like our friendship isn't a priority for you. I've been holding this in, but it's not going away—it's building up. I don't want to lose our friendship to resentment. Can you help me understand what's happening on your end?"

### Staying in Relationship

**How to close:** "I'm telling you this because I care about us. I don't want to pretend it's fine when it isn't. Whatever you're going through, I'm here. But I needed you to know how I'm feeling."

**Follow-up:** After the conversation, let them know you appreciate them hearing you. If the pattern continues, you may need to set clearer boundaries—but give them the chance to respond first. Change takes time.
